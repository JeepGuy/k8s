Autoscaling

OOB  as of K1.3 Horizontal scaling can be done automatically.
 - Deployment, Replication Controller, or ReplicaSet

 Scaling based on CPU usage possible

 other application based metrics available (request latency etc.)
     - to enable this must be started withthe env var ENABLE_CUSTOM_METRICS=true


Autoscaling will periodically query the utilization for the targeted pods.

Autoscaling will use heapster, the monitoring tool, to gather its metrics and make
scaling decisions
     - Heapster must be installed and running before autscaling will work.

Example:
Run a deploymnt with a pod with a Cpu resource request of 200m

 - 200m = 200 millipu (or 200 microcores)
 - 200m = 0.2, which is 20% of a CPU core of the running Node
    -- if the node has 2 cores, it is still 20% of a single core.

You can introduce auto-scaling at 50% of the CPU usage (which is 100m)

Horizontal POD Autoscaling will increase/descrease pods to maintain a target
CPU utilization of 50% (or 100m ~ 10% of core within this pod)

add to container spec

resources:
 reqeusts:
   cpu: 200m

must deploy a HorizontalPodAutoscaler
