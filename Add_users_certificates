Demo from user management.

Optional: ssh into your cluster. If not then copy the keys to the master node.

1. Create a new key and certificate for your user.
  sudo openssl req -new -key myuser.pem -out myuser-csr.pem -subj "/CN=myuser/O=myteam/"
              cn myuser is username, and myteam is the group
2. Create a new certicate from the .pem that is signed by your certificate authority.
   sudo openssl x509 -req -in myuser-csr.pem -CA /path/to/kubernetes/ca.crt
               -CAkey /path/to/kubernetes/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out myuser.crt -days 10000
3. Cat the certificate files
4. Copy them to your host system (your workstation)
   kubectl or minikube "name.key"
   and "name.crt"
5. Change the key name and location in your .kube/config file
   vim .kube/config

   Verify in your config file:
   kubectl config view
